# Dashborg Go SDK

Dashborg was built to be the simplest way to create web-based internal tools directly from backend code.
Cut out the overhead of configuring and hosting a web stack, and stop wrestling with JavaScript, AJAX, and UI libraries.

## New Dashborg Coming Soon!

Working through a complete Dashborg rewrite.  New docs/tutorials coming soon.

* Use HTML to define Dashborg Panels (using Declarative UI)
* Simple gRPC interface to backend
* Built in data-model / frontend state
* Can embed Dashborg Panels into existing web apps

## Why Dashborg?

I started my career as a backend developer.  I loved how
straightforward backend code was.  You open files, read command line
arguments, and write to the console.  I always hoped that writing to a
webpage would be just as simple.  Unfortunately, with all of the new
JS frameworks (and security requirements), it has only gotten harder
to create basic, good-looking, functional UI.  Creating a
UI/dashboard, even for a for a small command-line script, requires
working in multiple languages, configuring multiple frameworks, and
hosting a FE stack -- all things that might take more code than your
original script -- and it takes hours (if not days) to get it all up
and running!  On the other hand, the *only* way for non-engineers to
interact with your code is through the web.  So you either pay all the
cost to make an interface, or you don't.  I built Dashborg so you
don't have to make that choice.  Maybe then we could get more tools
online faster and get back to the real work of adding functionality,
not wrestling with and configuring FE technologies.
